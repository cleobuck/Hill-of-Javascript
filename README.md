# JS Hill

This repo is a set of exercises created by BECODE to get familiar and proficient in javascript.

While climbing the JS ladder, I fell in love with this language. I makes me feel like a superhero developper. 

Here is the link to the github page:

### Interface 

I created an index.html file to illustrate the different steps. All the letters represent the different themes of each exercise. I also played around with SVG animation for the first time by giving momentum to the stick man's body when an exercise is clicked :)

### Difficulties

Pure algorithms were easier to solve, as they are more intuitive. When the JS promises came up, it became tougher as it was hard to really grasp the inner workings of these objects.
